# Usage Instructions for PM

## When to Use This Template
Use for AgentTasks scored 6-15 complexity points:
- Multi-file features
- API endpoint implementations
- Complex bug fixes
- Integration work

## Template Population Steps

1. **Analyze Complexity** (6-15 points)
   - File impact: 2-10 files
   - Code volume: 50-500 lines
   - May have integrations
   - Some complexity

2. **Search Memory First**
   ```
   Search memory/Pattern/ for relevant patterns
   Search memory/Learning/ for solutions
   Embed findings in embedded_learnings
   ```

3. **Gather Context**
   - Get project root path
   - Load code standards from AGENTS.md
   - Find code examples from codebase
   - Include configuration values

4. **Define Goal Clearly**
   - One sentence summary
   - 2-3 measurable success criteria
   - Business value statement

5. **Plan Implementation**
   - High-level approach
   - Step-by-step tasks
   - Files to modify
   - Error handling strategy

6. **Set Validation Criteria**
   - Test requirements
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Manual testing steps

7. **Assign to Specialist**
   - Choose appropriate role
   - Provide complete context
   - Ensure all placeholders replaced

## Quality Checklist Before Delegation

- [ ] All {PLACEHOLDERS} replaced with actual values
- [ ] Memory search results embedded
- [ ] Code standards from AGENTS.md included
- [ ] Project root and file paths absolute
- [ ] Success criteria measurable
- [ ] Validation steps clear
- [ ] Specialist role appropriate

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Leaving placeholder values
❌ Forgetting to search memory
❌ Missing code standards
❌ Vague success criteria
❌ Incomplete context
❌ No validation steps

✅ Complete embedded context
✅ Memory patterns included
✅ Clear measurable goals
✅ Specific implementation steps
✅ Comprehensive validation
